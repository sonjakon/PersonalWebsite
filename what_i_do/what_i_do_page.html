            <p> Currently, I am leveraging my skills and knowledge as a Quality Assurance Engineer, specializing in
                manual testing. My experience includes working as a camera operator at ATV and as a Customer Service
                Representative at DDC MLS. Through these roles, I have developed a keen eye for detail, a strong work
                ethic, and excellent communication and organizational skills.
